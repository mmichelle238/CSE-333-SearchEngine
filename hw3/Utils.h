// Macros to convert 64-bit integers between "host order" and "network order".
//
// The on-disk format is big-endian, sometimes called "network order" since
// it's the commonly-used endianness in network protocols.  However, x86 is
// a little endian architecture.  Although <arpa/inet.h> header declares
// macros for converting 16-bit and 32-bit numbers back and forth (see also
// "man htonl"), we need one for 64-bit numbers.
//
// The following (crazy looking!) macros implement the 64-bit version of
// the arpa macros.  So, htonll() -- read aloud as "Host TO Network, Long
// Long" -- means converting from host order to big endian.  On a big-endian
// architecture, this is a no-op, but on a little-endian machine it swaps the
// byte order.

// A CRC32 object, useful for calculating a checksum.
//
// A checksum is a mathematical operation that calculates a "signature" of
// of some byte array; if the byte array gets corrupted later, a
// newly-calculated checksum won't match.  Checksums are therefore useful for
// validate the integrity of a byte array.
//
// To calculate a checksum, instantiate a CRC32 object and invoke
// FoldByteIntoCRC() repeatedly, once for each byte in the sequence.  Lastly,
// invoke GetFinalCRC() to retrieve the checksum for that byte sequence.  After
// you've called GetFinalCRC(), you cannot fold any additional bytes into
// that CRC32 instance.
//
// If you're curious, you can read about CRCs on wikipedia:
//   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check
